# WHAT IS THIS?
This is a webcam cycler that flips through webcams of places that I like. 

The idea is to have this on a small picture frame style monitor in my house, like the digital picture frame products but of webcams of cool places.


# TODO: 
    - Convert the current .csv to .db and extract video locations, time offsets, URLs with SQL query.
    - Integrate RPI button to switch to next video
    - Buy RPI screen (touchscreen?)
    - Make a frame for RPI + screen.
